# Ansible Workspace

This is a workspace for managing and organizing Ansible projects.

## Structure

The workspace is organized into several directories and files:

- `ansible.cfg`: Configuration file for Ansible.
- `inventory`: Lists the hosts where Ansible will run tasks.
- `roles`: Contains the roles that Ansible will use.
- `playbooks`: Contains the playbooks that Ansible will run.

Each role has its own directory under `roles`, and each of these directories may contain the following:

- `tasks`: Contains the main list of tasks that the role will execute.
- `handlers`: Contains handlers, which are tasks that will only be run if notified by another task.
- `templates`: Contains Jinja2 template files that Ansible will deploy to hosts.
- `files`: Contains static files that Ansible will deploy to hosts.
- `vars`: Contains variables that are used in the role.
- `defaults`: Contains default values for variables used in the role.
- `meta`: Contains metadata about the role.

## Usage

To use this workspace, update the `inventory` file with your hosts, update the roles and playbooks as needed, and run Ansible with the `-i` option pointing to your `inventory` file.

For example:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/playbook.yml
```
```
Please note that the actual content of the README.md file will depend on the specific requirements and details of your Ansible workspace.
